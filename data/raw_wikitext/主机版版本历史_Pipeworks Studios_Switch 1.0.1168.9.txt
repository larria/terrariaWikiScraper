; 修复 Bug
* Along with this long-desired feature comes a solid handful of bug fixes - both for two-player Splitscreen and for the core Single Player experience. Let's take a quick moment to dive into the details so that you can get started today on your Splitscreen experience!

; 分屏
* To start your Splitscreen adventure, you will need a second paired set of controls and each player will need their own user account on the Switch. With all of that in place, here is how you get going!
** Player One should start up a Single Player game - choose their character and the world on which you want to play
** Once the game has loaded completely, Player Two should pick up their controller and press the A button
** This will bring up the User Account Selection Menu - Player Two then selects their Switch User Account
** Upon selecting their account, Player Two will be able to select any Character files tied to that account (or create a new one if they do not have any)
** Once Player Two picks their Character, they will load into the game... and off you and your buddy go on your Splitscreen Terraria adventures!
* All other controls should work as per the normal game, just with a bit different viewport. Note that you can zoom in/out just as you can with Single Player (Pause, ZL/ZR) to allow for greater visibility.
