; 主要特性
* 所有 {{desktop}} [[1.3.0.7]] 内容
* Touch screen support to quickly navigate inventory and add more finesse in building, digging and combat (two joy-con controllers required per player)
** Under Settings in the Main Menu, and in the in-game Settings Menu, you can access a list of Touch Controls you can use in Terraria, including:
*** While in-game, you can pinch the screen to zoom in and out
**** Fair warning - this also uses your currently selected item, so make sure you don’t have a consumable selected!
** You can zoom all the way out to the full-screen map this way
** 可以点击屏幕以使用 / 放置{{tr|items}}
** There is also a zoom magnifier to help you see where you’re touching!
** 你可以点击{{tr|minimap}}以打开大{{tr|map}}
** You can also tap and drag the fullsize map to pan around
** You can tap and drag items around the Inventory and Equipment screen. Double-tapping an item in the inventory will enter build mode with it if applicable.
** In build mode you’ll get a semi-transparent grid around your character for extra-precise placement, also a good reminder that you’re in build mode
**你可以双击{{tr|Hotbar}}以打开{{tr|the Inventory}}
** 你可以双击切换{{tr|Accessory}}的可见性
** You can tap buffs to cancel them, and most in-inventory/shop/chest functions are accessible with touch! Try tapping ‘Loot All’ instead of dragging the highlight all the way over there.
** You can use touch to interact with the virtual keyboard as well.
* HD Rumble, which can be deactivated by navigating to the Switch Settings menu -> Controllers and Sensors and turning off Controller Vibration
* Up to 8-player online play (Nintendo Switch Online subscription required)
* Note that local docked split-screen and local wireless multiplayer are not included and will be added in future updates
