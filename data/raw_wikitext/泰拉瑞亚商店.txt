| [[File:LegendaryTerrarianYoyo.jpg|100px]] ||Legendary Terrarian || '''Official Description:''' In Terraria, you need to kill the Moonlord to have a chance to get a Terrarian yo-yo.  That chance is exactly 11.11%, repeating of course. It’s the best weapon in the game, and the best version is the one that rolls with the “Godly” modifier. We are still waiting for details, but the Terrarian might be unseated as the best weapon in the game by the Legendary Terrarian.  Keep an eye out for announcements from Re-Logic on that. And as is now tradition, the Legendary Terrarian is also coming to the real world.  We are using the same technique as we did on the Seven Summits and the Kuntosh 5000QV:  the Legendary Terrarian is made from 7075 aluminum alloy (the original is 6061) and the weight distribution is changed so the total weight is less than the original, even though 7075 is more dense (weighs more).  What that means is it looks the same to your eye in play as the original, but it feels totally different. You will notice the visual changes in the cup. This procedure is now known as “Boosted”. Are you ready for the next level?<br/>

| [[File:TerrarianYoyo.jpg|100px]] ||Terrarian || '''Official Description:''' We are proud to be in an amazing partnership with independent game studio Re-Logic who develop the open-ended 2D sandbox video game Terraria. Lead designer and head of Re-Logic, Andrew "Redigit" Spinks, approached us in early 2015 with the idea of implementing our yo-yos into the game and we loved it. Over the next few months we worked with Re-Logic and "uploaded" some of your favorite One Drops into the vast digital landscape of Terraria. You'll stumble upon models such as the Cascade, Valor, Yelets and much more throughout your journey in the game. As you draw near the end of your adventure, you'll encounter the Moon Lord, widely known as the "Final Boss". If you are able to take down this behemoth, you have a chance to receive the ultimate yo-yo in the game, the Terrarian. We decided to "download" the Terrarian and bring it to real life and pull the collaboration full circle. We worked closely with Andrew and zoned in on his thoughts and ideas for designing the ultimate One Drop. The Terrarian sports a wide wing shaped profile that will never want to miss your string segments or enemies you'll want to take down in the game! Thanks to a new machining technique, we were able to balance the weight distribution through the wall, boasting a powerful, yet floaty sensation during play. The Projection Profile is featured throughout the entire catch zone, with a subtle bump at the wing transition - it gives your nerve endings a unique feeling after a long critical combo. With Side Effects as the axle system, you have the opportunity to change how the yo-yo feels, plays and look. The initial release of colorways are based on different "Biomes" you'll find yourself exploring during your campaign in Terraria. Get lost in "Crimson" and take down a few Crimeras, or even do a little mining while you're taking a stroll through "Surface Grass". You're truly the one creating the story. Suit up and game on!<br/>

| [[File:KrakenYoyo.png|100px]] ||Kraken || '''Official Description:''' We are proud to be expanding our amazing partnership with independent game studio Re-Logic once again by bringing another yo-yo from the game of Terraria into reality: The Kraken. As the name suggests, the Kraken is monstrous. Equipped with a beefy body and 60mm diameter, the Kraken is our largest yo-yo to date. With it's 1/200 drop rate in the game, only a handful of players all over the world can say they've tamed the beast. Be on your A-Game, because the Kraken demands constant control and finesse. If you fumble a bit during play, it'll come biting. Don't fret though, pick yourself up and go at it again. No one said it was going to be easy. You could call it an "H" shape but the transitions are so soft and bulbous that it kind of defies a label like this. Just because it's a beast, doesn't mean it's going to feel like a rock during play; strangely, almost magically, it feels agile and light. In Terraria, the Kraken has "infinite spin". We honestly didn't think it'd be fair to other yo-yo companies to apply the "infinite spin" modifier to the real life Kraken, so we gave it just enough spin for you to pull off your favorite tricks. While the virtual Kraken can only be found in a post-Plantera dungeon, the real world Kraken will be relatively easy to track down and in many of the colorways you've all come to love on the Terrarian, as well as a handful of new ones! Hidden away from the world for far too long, we think it's time to finally release the Kraken!<br/>
